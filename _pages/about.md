Hi there! Welcome to my page! I'm Renyun Li (李仁赟/yūn/), first-year Purdue ECE PhD student. My past research, internship, and education have intricately woven an electric and theoretical background, encompassing 3D Vision, segmentation, compression, and SLAM. 

Before that, I got my M.S. degree in ECE from NYU under the supervision of [Prof. Yao Wang](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/yao-wang) in [Video Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/videolab/people/), working on 3D point cloud segmentation, motion estimation, and compressing. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Optoelectronic Information Science and Engineering at Tianjin University. Fun fact: I had to finish 4 yrs credits requirement of ECE in 2 yrs due to the inevitable mistake of the department. Therefore, I earned 100.5 credits during my 3rd year of undergrad.

Besides, I also worked as MLE in 

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, my academic journey took an unexpected gap year (20'-21'). I joined NXP Semiconductors as a Software Engineer Intern in Edge Processing team, working on 3D Vision with Mingkai Hu. After that, I joined [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, Tsinghua University](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) as a visiting scholar. Led by [Prof. Jianyu Chen](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jychen/), we worked on RL, POMDP, and 3D Vision.

Before that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Optoelectronic Information Science and Engineering at Tianjin University. Collaborated with Prof. Tiegen Liu, we worked on 3D point cloud and Optics. During my undergrad, I participated in two papers published in SPIE and Applied Physics, five patents, and received 33 honors and awards, including 5 at national level.

Fun fact: I had to finish 4 yrs credits requirement of ECE in 2 yrs due to the inevitable mistake of the department. Therefore, I earned 100.5 credits during my 3rd year of undergrad. This experience cultivated my multitasking abilities and nurtured my profound self-learning skills, which now serve as invaluable assets in pursuing higher education, internships, and research.

Spare time: Apart from academics, I particularly enjoy outdoor sports such as hiking, kayaking, skiing, and regular workouts. My bench press, deadlift, squat = 100kg, 160kg, 150kg. Aerobic exercises provide tranquility, while anaerobic workouts serve as a way to alleviate stress, offering a healthy outlet from academic demands. Additionally, my musical journey commenced with the melodies of the piano when I was 9 years old.
