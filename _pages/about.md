Welcome to my page! I'm Renyun Li (李仁赟), Master student from NYU ECE. My past research, internship, and education has intricately woven an electric and theoretical background, encompassing CV, SLAM, Optics, RL, 3D point cloud, and software-hardware co-design.
Currently, I focus on Image and Video Processing, 3D Vision, segmentation, reconstruction, motion estimation, and computational imaging.

In NYU, I'm fortunate to be advised by advised by [Prof. Yao Wang](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/yao-wang) in [Video Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/videolab/people/), working on 3D point cloud segmentation, motion estimation, and compressing. I also worked as a RA with [Prof. Siddharth Garg](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/siddharth-garg) in [ENSURE RESEARCH GROUP](https://wp.nyu.edu/ensure_group/), TA of CS-GY 6953 Deep Learning, as well as instructor in the NYU STEM K12 bootcamp of ML.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and visa-related complications, my academic journey took an unexpected gap year (20'-21'). I joined NXP Semiconductors as a Software Engineer Intern in Edge Processing team, working on AIoT and 3D Vision with Mingkai Hu. After that, I joined [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, Tsinghua University](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) as a RA. Led by [Prof. Jianyu Chen](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jychen/), we worked on RL, POMDP, 3D Vision, and Autonomous Driving.

Before that, I obtained my Bachelor degree in Optoelectronic Information Science and Engineering (under ECE) at Tianjin University. Collaborated with Prof. Tiegen Liu, Prof. Hai Pang and Prof. Shuang Wang, we worked on 3D point cloud and Optics. During my undergrad, I participated two papers published in SPIE and the Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics, secured five patents, and received 33 honors and awards, including 5 at national-level.
