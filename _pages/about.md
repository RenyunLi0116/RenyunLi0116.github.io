Welcome to my page! I'm Renyun Li (李仁赟/yūn/). My past research, internship, and education has intricately woven an electric and theoretical background, encompassing 3D Vision, segmentation, compression, and SLAM. Currently, I focus on 3D Vision, segmentation, reconstruction, and motion estimation.

In NYU, I'm fortunate to be advised by advised by [Prof. Yao Wang](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/yao-wang) in [Video Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/videolab/people/), working on 3D point cloud segmentation, motion estimation, and compressing. My graduate project is to design a PointNet-based model infused with motion estimation for human 3D point clouds segmentation, paving the way for the compression of 3D video based on this.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, my academic journey took an unexpected gap year (20'-21'). I joined NXP Semiconductors as a Software Engineer Intern in Edge Processing team, working on AIoT and 3D Vision with Mingkai Hu. After that, I joined [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, Tsinghua University](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) as a RA. Led by [Prof. Jianyu Chen](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jychen/), we worked on RL, POMDP, 3D Vision, and Autonomous Driving.

Before that, I obtained my Bachelor degree in Optoelectronic Information Science and Engineering at Tianjin University. Collaborated with Prof. Tiegen Liu, we worked on 3D point cloud and Optics. During my undergrad, I participated two papers published in SPIE and Applied Physics, five patents, and received 33 honors and awards, including 5 at national-level. 

One fun fact here is that I had to finish 4 yrs credits requirement of ECE in 2 yrs due to inevitable mistake of department. Therefore, I earned 54.5 credits in Fall 2018 and 46 credits in Spring 2019(including minor). This experience cultivated my multitasking abilities and nurtured my profound self-directed learning skills. These attributes now serve as invaluable assets in pursuing higher education, internships, and research.

Apart from academics, I particularly enjoy outdoor sports such as hiking, kayaking, skiing, and regular workouts. My bench press, deadlift, and squat stand at 100kg, 160kg, and 180kg respectively. Aerobic exercises provide tranquility, while anaerobic workouts serve as a way to alleviate stress, offering a healthy outlet from academic demands. Additionally, my musical journey commenced with the melodies of the piano when I was 9 yrs old.
